This is small express router+CRUD on MongoDB 

• express is the Node framework.
• morgan allows us to log all requests to the console so we can see exactly what is going on. </br>
• mongoose is the ODM we will use to communicate with our MongoDB database.</br>
• body-parser will let us pull POST content from our HTTP request so that we can do things like create a user.</br>
• bcrypt-nodejs will allow us to hash our passwords since it is never safe to store passwords plaintext in our databases. </br>
